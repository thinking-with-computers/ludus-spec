# Ludus by example
## A way of working out syntax & semantics
The idea here is to develop a series of examples to test against different syntactical changes. The idea is that these examples should be comprehensible, easy, elegant. But also real-world challenging test cases for Ludus. So some of them will be very early examples in learning (to optimize for "no floor"), and some of them will be basic algorithms, patterns, and tools implemented in Ludus (a self-hosted stdlib, some of which may or may not actually be used in practice).

This will give us news about the language, and sand things down, before we get too far along with implementation.

### List of examples

#### Turtle graphics
* Draw a square
* Draw a flower

#### Core Ludus/Kredati libraries
* Basic vector math
  
#### Algorithms
* `reduce`
* `transduce`
* Some basic transducers (`map`, `filter`, `take`)
* Lisp list operations: `cons`, `car`, `cdr`, and some examples with them: `reduce`, `map`, `filter`
