# Ludus's transitional objects

A quick thought for now, based on an archival trouvaille in Papert's papers ("Goldstein: ATLAS, a data structure project").

Logo's most basic transitional object is the command. Procedural epistemology starts as a knowing-how, in the sense that you break a task down into component parts.

But this breakdown (introducing data structures, and how to query them) doesn't rely on command/execution, but rather _question and answer_.

In other words, in a procedural paradigm, you are _telling_ a computer to add two numbers. In a functional paradigm, you are _asking_ the computer what the sum of two numbers.
